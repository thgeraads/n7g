## iPod Nano 7 Theme Previewer 
### v0.1.0
This is the first version of the iPod Nano 7 Theme Previewer, made mainly for theme creators to quickly check how their icons and wallpapers look on different iPod Nano 7 colors.

### What it can do right now:
- Load your own .ipsw files to preview your theme
- Load .ipsw files from a URL (limited options for now)
- Preview app icons and wallpapers based on the device color (only the 2012 colors are supported for now)

### What’s coming next:
- More themes to choose from
- Support for 2015 iPod colors
- The ability to "open" apps in the preview
- A wallpaper picker that looks more like the original n7g OS
- A working status bar

### Who is this for?
Mainly theme creators who want to double-check if everything looks right.
Regular users won’t find much to do here yet, but more preview features are on the way.

### Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature?
Head over to the GitHub issues page and let me know. (Or use the buttons in the top bar!)
